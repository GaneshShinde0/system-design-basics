# System Design: Designing a Rate Limiter

## Introduction
A rate limiter is a crucial component in distributed systems that helps control the rate of incoming requests to prevent overload and ensure fair resource allocation. In this system design, we will explore how to design a rate limiter using Java and Python.

## Requirements
1. The rate limiter should limit the number of requests per second (RPS) from a client.
2. The rate limiter should be scalable and able to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
3. The rate limiter should be able to differentiate between different clients and apply different rate limits accordingly.
4. The rate limiter should be highly available and fault-tolerant.

### Clarify Requirements
Functional Requirements:
- Limit the number of requests per second (RPS) from a client.
- Differentiate between different clients and apply different rate limits.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Scalability to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
- High availability and fault tolerance.
- Low latency to ensure minimal impact on request processing.

### Choose the Rate Limiting Algorithm
- Fixed Window: Simple but can cause bursts at the window boundaries.
- Sliding Window: More accurate but complex.
- Token Bucket: Flexible and handles bursts well.
- Leaky Bucket: Smoothens out bursts but can be less flexible.

### Design Data Structures
Client Information:
- client_id: Unique identifier for the client.
- request_count: Number of requests made in the current window.
- last_request_timestamp: Timestamp of the last request.

Rate Limit Configuration:
- client_id: Unique identifier for the client.
- rate_limit: Maximum number of requests allowed per second.

### Implement Rate Limiter Logic
Initialization:
- Load rate limit configurations for each client.

Request Handling:
- Check the current timestamp.
- Update the request count based on the chosen algorithm.
- Compare the request count with the rate limit.
- Allow or block the request based on the comparison.

### Handle Distributed Systems Challenges
Synchronization:
- Use distributed data stores like Redis or Memcached to store rate limiting data.
- Ensure atomic operations to update request counts.

Coordination:
- Use consistent hashing to distribute clients across multiple rate limiter instances.
- Implement leader election for coordination if needed.

Fault Tolerance:
- Replicate rate limiting data across multiple nodes.
- Implement failover mechanisms.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Log rate limiting events for auditing and debugging.
- Monitor rate limiter performance and adjust configurations as needed.

## Design Steps

### Step 1: Determine the Rate Limiting Algorithm
Choose an appropriate rate limiting algorithm based on your requirements. Some popular algorithms include:
- Fixed Window: Limits the number of requests within a fixed time window.
- Sliding Window: Limits the number of requests within a sliding time window.
- Token Bucket: Uses tokens to limit the rate of requests.

### Step 2: Design the Data Structures
Design the necessary data structures to store information about clients and their request rates. This could include:
- A data structure to store client information (e.g., IP address, request count, last request timestamp).
- A data structure to track the rate limit for each client.

### Step 3: Implement the Rate Limiter Logic
Implement the rate limiter logic based on the chosen algorithm. This could involve:
- Tracking the number of requests made by each client.
- Checking if the client has exceeded the rate limit.
- Applying appropriate actions (e.g., blocking, throttling) when the rate limit is exceeded.

### Step 4: Handle Distributed Systems Challenges
Consider the challenges of implementing a rate limiter in a distributed system. Some considerations include:
- Synchronization and coordination between multiple instances of the rate limiter.
- Handling high concurrency and ensuring thread safety.
- Scaling the rate limiter to handle a large number of requests.

### Step 5: Test and Monitor the Rate Limiter
Test the rate limiter thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements. Monitor its performance and make necessary optimizations if needed.

## Code Examples

### Java Implementation

```java
// Java Implementation
public class RateLimiter {
	private Map<String, Integer> requestCount;
	private Map<String, Long> lastRequestTime;
	private int rateLimit;
	private Map<String, String> clientToGateway;

	public RateLimiter(int rateLimit) {
		this.rateLimit = rateLimit;
		this.requestCount = new HashMap<>();
		this.lastRequestTime = new HashMap<>();
		this.clientToGateway = new HashMap<>();
	}

	public boolean isAllowed(String client) {
		if (!requestCount.containsKey(client)) {
			requestCount.put(client, 0);
			lastRequestTime.put(client, System.currentTimeMillis());
			return true;
		}

		int count = requestCount.get(client);
		long lastTime = lastRequestTime.get(client);
		long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

		if (currentTime - lastTime >= 1000) {
			requestCount.put(client, 0);
			lastRequestTime.put(client, currentTime);
			return true;
		}

		if (count < rateLimit) {
			requestCount.put(client, count + 1);
			return true;
		}

		return false;
	}

	public void setClientToGateway(String client, String gateway) {
		clientToGateway.put(client, gateway);
	}

	public String getClientGateway(String client) {
		return clientToGateway.get(client);
	}
}
```

### Python Implementation

```python
import time
from collections import defaultdict

class RateLimiter:
	def __init__(self, rate_limit):
		self.rate_limit = rate_limit
		self.request_count = defaultdict(int)
		self.last_request_time = defaultdict(lambda: time.time())

	def is_allowed(self, client):
		current_time = time.time()
		
		if client not in self.request_count:
			self.request_count[client] = 0
			self.last_request_time[client] = current_time
			return True

		count = self.request_count[client]
		last_time = self.last_request_time[client]

		if current_time - last_time >= 1:
			self.request_count[client] = 0
			self.last_request_time[client] = current_time
			return True

		if count < self.rate_limit:
			self.request_count[client] += 1
			return True

		return False
}

# Example usage

rate_limiter = RateLimiter(rate_limit=5)  # 5 requests per second
client = "client1"

if rate_limiter.is_allowed(client):
	print("Request allowed")
else:
	print("Rate limit exceeded")
```
